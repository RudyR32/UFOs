# UFOs
## Background
Dana has set out the goal of creating a web page that talks about the Truth around UFO sightings.  The webpage and dynamic table Dana has built are working as intended, but Dana has decided she would like the table to be filtered even further. While it currently filters by the date, she would like to include the ability to filter by more column headers. The ability to pinpoint a search by date and country, for example, would go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.
## Skills Used
-Javascipt<br/>
-HTML<br/>
-D3(for Event Listening)
## Project Summary
The webpage was created with a table containing hundreds UFO sightings.  To make this more managable we have added 5 filters (Date, City, State, Country and Shape).  This allows us to dring down and review sightings with the attributes we are looking for.  A screenshot is shown below.
